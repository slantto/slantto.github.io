    "Over the last week we've accomplished the following tasks:\n",
    "\n",
    "-  Recovered from data loss by reconverting all FC1 and FC2 *final* bagfiles to HDF5/Pytables\n",
    "-  Stood up IPython Parallel Cluster\n",
    "-  Ran PNP on all 8 flights using parallel cluster\n",
    "    - Added additional category to store stats individually on PNP Error, and added another output table for features that passed the Brute Force Matcher but RANSAC kicked out\n",
    "    - Haven't been to base yet today, but was complete with 8/10 yesterday for a 100+ hour run. Could make this more parallel in the future (right now each job is processed on an individual flight, and I have an idle node)\n",
    "- Have an additional IPython notebook for neogeo database operations where we look at:\n",
    "    - How to load a subset of features from the database. Answers the question on how to load a fixed number of features using both feature metrics and enforcing geometric diversity.\n",
    "    - Built a FLANN database from that subset, and run the neogeo observation likelihood first step (matching to that subset and binning the matches)\n",
    "    - Built a visualization of the results using matplotlib animation"

    "Goals for the upcoming week:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Outline JNC 2015 presentation (mostly done, just need to figure out what results we want to show)\n",
    "    - Have a bunch of the background material ready, just which results\n",
    "        - Flight test aggregation, show flight paths for at least the first two flight campaigns\n",
    "        - Show details of the database itself, implementaiton and some of the aggregation results\n",
    "        - Show how we used metrics of the features to downsample the database\n",
    "        - Show some of the visualization of NEOGEO running for one flight? \n",
    "        - Show NED error for PNP for at least one flight, hopefully all flights\n",
    "        - Show mapping of PNP error to the database\n",
    "        - How do we show the real time results? Do we show these first and then go into analysis / post processing? \n",
    "    - And then path to get the results:\n",
    "        - Currently have raw matches from neogeo, need to: \n",
    "            - Convert these to likelihood\n",
    "            - Run the filter with the motion model\n",
    "        - PnP is currently running with the BFMatcher, too many features, and is estimating attitude\n",
    "        - To get to real time (<1sec) we'd need to: \n",
    "            - Subsample the features from both the image and the database (easy)\n",
    "            - Implement FLANN if that subsampling is still too slow with BFMatcher (might not be -- numpy dot product of 5k by 20k is about 400msec; FLANN is ~605 to build the indes and then 9mses to search it, so only faster if we're observing the same tile a few times in a row)\n",
    "            - Or we could just ignore real time for the time being and test with \n"
